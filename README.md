# Schlink_Portfolio
Portfolio of projects done for personal and academic use. Unless otherwise stated, all work contained within was completed by Schlink.

## [Project 1: Importing and Visualisation of Ocean Colour Data (Sea Surface Temperature)](https://github.com/Schlink/MATLAB_repo)
**Project overview:**
1. Imported Sea Surface Temperature data in netCDF files and batch processed them to subscene data of the Tasman Sea.
2. Batch processed the subscened data to visualise the sea surface temperature of the Tasman Sea.
3. In this example, I processed files from 2010 to 2015 as a demonstration so that the subplots look more pleasing to the eye as too many subplots would result in a very squished look.
